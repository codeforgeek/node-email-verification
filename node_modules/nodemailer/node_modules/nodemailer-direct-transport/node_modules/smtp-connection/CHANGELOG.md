## v1.3.6 2015-12-19

  * Validate to and from address to be valid e-mail addresses

## v1.3.2 2015-12-16

  * Added missing 'close' and 'end' event handlers for a STARTTLS-upgraded socket

## v1.3.1 2015-06-30

## v1.2.0 2015-03-09

  * Connection object has a new property `secure` that indicates if the current connection is using a secure TLS socket or not
  * Fixed `requireTLS` where the connection was established insecurely if STARTTLS failed, now it returns an error as it should if STARTTLS fails

## v1.1.0 2014-11-11

  * Added additional constructor option `requireTLS` to ensure that the connection is upgraded before any credentials are passed to the server
  * Added additional constructor option `socket` to use an existing socket instead of creating new one (bantu)

## v1.0.2 2014-10-15

  * Removed CleartextStream.pair.encrypted error handler. Does not seem to be supported by Node v0.11

## v1.0.1 2014-10-15

## v1.0.0 2014-09-26

  * Changed version scheme from 0.x to 1.x.
  * Improved error handling for timeout on creating a connection. Caused issues with `once('error')` handler as an error might have been emitted twice
